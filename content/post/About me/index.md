Thank you for coming to understand what kind of person I am!


## Summary

A third year high school student studying at Haikou Experimental High School (just a plaything for the principal).

There are two main internet names used: 山雨欲来风满楼/恍惚交错落花雨
Pen names include: 寻轩/清水
Sometimes I also use a pseudonym: 林星萱
If you want to address me directly, I hope you can use the pen name "寻轩".

A 東方Project Enthusiast😇

Attempted to learn C++(shit), Rust (give up), ASP (fail), PHP (not implemented), Python/Micro Python (Power By GPT), and even wrote poorly in HTML/CSS/JavaScript (haha); 
Having tinkered with entry-level embedded/electronic design, I have not yet achieved the goal of lighting up an MCU. I look forward to continuing to work hard; 
I have learned a little experimental chemistry (just to the extent that I won't blow up the laboratory); 
Understand some basic RF knowledge, only understand that some antennas pointing towards mobile phones have poor signal; 
Skilled in network engineering, capable of torturing and exploding routers;
**Attempting to create a simple satellite with vague knowledge**

Understand some layout design (skill point: -1). Having written one point eight part essay (thesis), proficient in the formatting of eight part essays; Participated in the layout design work of the Library Daily and received widespread negative reviews.

I have won the first prize and third prize in the National Information Technology Innovation and Practice Competition (NOC) in Hainan Province (just a consolation award).

****************

一名就读于海口实验中学的高三年级学生（校长的玩物罢了）。

主要使用的网名有两个：山雨欲来风满楼/恍惚交错落花雨
笔名有：寻轩/清水
有时也会用化名：林星萱
如果你要直接称呼我，我希望你能够使用“寻轩”这个笔名。

一个云车万人😇

试图学习过C艹（shit）、Rust（放弃）、ASP（失败）、PHP（未实现）、Python/Micro Python（Power By GPT），连HTML/CSS/JavaScript都写的稀烂（笑）；
折腾过一点入门级嵌入式/电子设计，目前还没有达到点亮一颗MCU的成就，期待继续努力；
学过一点实验化学（仅仅是不会把实验室炸了的那种程度）；
了解一些基础的射频知识，只明白有些天线指向手机信号不好；
会一点网络工程，能把路由器折磨炸的那种；
**正在试图用微渺的知识制造一颗简单的卫星。**

了解一点排版设计（技能点：-1）。写过一点八股文（论文），由此精通八股文的排版格式；参与过《图书馆报》的排版设计工作，获得广泛**恶**评。

曾获得全国中小学信息技术创新与实践大赛（NOC）的海南省一等奖与全国三等奖（不过是一个安慰奖罢了）。


## Failed Programmers

A person who dares to bravely retreat from the current.

I have learned/learned many programming languages, but most of them have given up, and then I threw their textbooks on the dusty bookshelf. Some programming languages that I still understand are disappearing from my mind.

If I were a formal programmer, I would definitely be one of the first to be replaced by ChatGPT. 

But no matter what, I can still write code that meets my needs, and I think that's enough.

****************

一个敢于急流勇退的人。

我学过很多编程语言，但大多数都放弃了，然后我把他们的教材扔到了满是灰尘的书架上，而一些我仍稍微掌握的编程语言也正在从我的脑海中消失。

如果我是一名正式的程序员，我肯定会是第一批被ChatGPT取代的人之一。

但不管怎样，我仍然可以编写满足我需求的代码，我认为这就足够了。


## An ignorant hardware player

I can assemble a computer without inserting the graphics card into the memory slot, but that's all.

I only know how to use Raspberry Pi's IQ tax products, and even the microcontroller comes from the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

Proficient in electronic engineering (referring to the ability to connect light bulbs and power sources)

At present, the achievement of lighting up an MCU/resistor has not been achieved.

****************

我能在组装电脑的时候不把显卡插到内存插槽中，但是也仅此而已。

我只会使用树莓派的智商税产品，连单片机都来自树莓派基金会。

会一点电子工程（指会把灯泡和电源连起来）

目前还未达成点亮一颗MCU/电阻的成就。


## Experimental operators who give up halfway (operator consumables) 

I used to be very interested in chemistry and also used many experimental tools to conduct chemistry experiments at home. 

Later on, I had to give up this hobby because I entered a boarding school, but it also prevented me from blowing up my home.

****************

曾经对化学很感兴趣，也整了很多的实验用具在家开展化学实验。

后续因为进入寄宿制学校不得不放弃这一爱好，不过这也避免了我把我家给爆破了。

## A HAM
### (Amateur radio enthusiasts)

Amateur radio is a very interesting field, and I am an entry-level amateur radio enthusiast.

I currently hold a license for amateur radio stations in the People's Republic of China. The radio station call sign is BG7ZDQ, and I sometimes use the SWL call sign BY7030SWL.

My area of interest is reception (RX), and I have built an amateur radio receiving station. I often receive data from meteorological satellites, such as VHF satellite cloud maps from NOAA series and METERO series satellites. Due to limitations, I am currently limited to LEO (low Earth orbit) and SSO (sun synchronous orbit) satellites, but I have plans to advance towards GEO (geostationary orbit).

I sometimes carry out launch activities, and you may see me on a satellite with an active FM voice transmitter.

Give you the beautiful 73!

****************

业余无线电是一个很有意思的领域，而我是一个入门级的业余无线电爱好者。

我目前持有中华人民共和国业余无线电台执照，无线电台呼号BG7ZDQ，我有时也会使用SWL呼号BY7030SWL。

我较为感兴趣的方向为接收（RX），我建有一个业余无线电接收站。我经常接收气象类卫星下传的数据，例如NOAA系列卫星和METERO系列卫星下发的VHF卫星云图。因为条件限制，我目前还是局限于LEO（低地球轨道）与SSO（太阳同步轨道）卫星，但是我有计划向GEO（地球同步轨道）进军。

我有时也会进行发射活动，你可能会在带有活动的FM语音转发器的卫星上见到我。

将美好的73送给您！

## 東方Project Enthusiast

I am a fan of the Oriental Project.

The Oriental Project is a fan culture with a long history, and its intricate and vast worldview and numerous characters deeply attract me. I strongly recommend that you also learn more, and you will definitely be impressed!

I am the fan of 『チルノ』 and 『東風谷早苗』. I love these two characters the most. If you are willing to sponsor me, please give me their Crafts(haha)!

****************


我是一个东方Project的爱好者。

东方Project是一个有长久历史的同人文化圈，其精密庞大的世界观和众多的角色深深地吸引了我，我强烈推荐你也去多了解一些，你一定也会被折服的！

我是『チルノ』和『東風谷早苗』厨，我最喜欢这两个角色，如果您愿意赞助我，那就请给我她们的周边吧（笑）！

## Aerospace Enthusiast

Compared to amateur radio, my hobby in aerospace (excluding the satellite field) is more "amateur".

I once self-taught a part of the theory of rocket engines and sounding rockets, but it was only a superficial experience; I am concerned about space launch and excited about it, but it does not prevent me from confusion about which engines are available in the YF series in China.

But ultimately, I yearn for the vastness, romance, and mystery of space. You may not have thought that I gathered my many hobbies and came up with the idea of creating an amateur radio satellite with an Eastern Project theme This is very unrealistic, but I am willing to put in a fight.

I hope to succeed.

****************

相较于业余无线电，我的航天爱好（卫星领域除外）才更加“业余”。

我曾经自学了一部分火箭发动机和探空火箭的理论，但也只是浅尝辄止；我关心航天发射，并为此感到激动，但是这并不妨碍我搞不清中国YF系列都有哪些发动机。

但是，总归我是向往浩瀚无垠，充满浪漫与神秘的太空的。你可能没有想到，我把我的众多爱好聚合起来，萌发了制造一颗东方Project主题的业余无线电卫星的想法......这很脱离现实，但我愿意一拼。

希望能够成功吧。


## Typography enthusiasts

I like things that look good and have a sense of design, so sometimes I try to design things or layout some printed materials myself.

But I'm really not good at it.

I have designed some cultural and creative works for my alma mater and also served as a typesetting editor for the Library Journal.

****************

我喜欢好看的，有设计感的东西，所以有的时候也会自己试着去设计一些东西或者排版一些印刷品。

不过我真的很不擅长。

目前曾设计过一些我的母校的文创，还担任过《图书馆报》的排版编辑。


## Political thought

This is a chaotic topic, and all I have to say is two words:

1. The unity of people is incredible, and we need to use magical "friendship" bonds to connect all people together.
2. Without academic democracy and intellectual freedom, science cannot prosper.

Similarly, I oppose discrimination, bullying, war, and all unreasonable things.
Similarly, I am also friendly to LGBTQ+(excluding those who use LGBTQ+for special treatment)

****************

这是个混沌的话题，我想说的只有两句话：

1.人们的联合是不可思议的，我们要用神奇的“友爱”纽带把所有的人联系在一起。
2.没有学术的民主和思想的自由，科学就不能繁荣。

同样，我反对歧视，反对霸凌，反对战争，反对一切不合理的事情。
同样，我也对LGBTQ+友好（利用LGBTQ+来获得特殊待遇的人除外）

谨作于2024年春
